		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		Hello World from <b> Karl </b> <br>
		I am an astrophysics graduate from Trinity College Dublin.
		<h3> Background </h3>
		</p>I have just received offers from the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London to study machine learning and physics <br> 
This means I will have to decide between those two courses, both are in similar topics but the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-physical-sciences/" target="_blank">Imperial course</a> is an MRes, meaning there is a huge research project component.
Also London is extremely vibrant and I know lots of my friends moving there. Whereas the <a href="https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/pcphmpdis" target="_blank"> Cambridge  course</a> is an MPhil and has much more of a taught component, maybe giving a better grounding in the ML fundamentals. It does also have minor modules which are broad in scope and in some very interesting topics meaning I will get more exposure to different projects. Also Cam has a long project thesis too. </p>
