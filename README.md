# Personal Site (Typewriter Aesthetic) — Updated

Changes:
- Theme toggle now uses high-contrast icon color in dark mode and spins on click.
- Timeline is full-height on the page (no inner scroll box).
- Added more placeholder experience entries.
- Added favicon placeholders (`assets/favicon.png`, `assets/apple-touch-icon.png`) showing “KN”. Replace with your own to customize.
- Blog post links now point to working sample pages in `posts/`.

## Where to upload/replace the favicon
- Replace **`assets/favicon.png`** (32×32 PNG) and **`assets/apple-touch-icon.png`** (180×180 PNG).
- You can also add `favicon.ico` if you prefer; add `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">` to `index.html`.
